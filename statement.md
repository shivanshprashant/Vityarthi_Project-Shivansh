 Project Problem Statement

1. Problem Statement

In the field of Data Science, beginners often struggle to understand the difference between Classification(categorizing data) and Regression(predicting numbers). There is a need for a unified, modular tool that can ingest different types of datasets, automatically clean them, visualize their patterns, and apply the correct machine learning algorithm without complex manual configuration.

2. Scope of the Project

The scope includes:

 Ingesting data from standard libraries (Iris and Diabetes).
    
Preprocessing data to ensure quality (removing duplicates/nulls).
    
Visualizing data distributions and correlations.
    
Implementing fundamental AI models (KNN for classification, Linear Regression for regression).
    
3. Target Users

Data Science students.
    
Beginner AI researchers.
    
Academic faculty demonstrating ML concepts.
    
4. High-Level Features

Dual-Mode Operation: Supports both Classification and Regression.
    
Auto-EDA: Automatic generation of histograms and heatmaps.
    
ML Pipeline: Built-in training and evaluation metrics.
